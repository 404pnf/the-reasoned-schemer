This repository contains all the code examples from the book "The Reasoned
Schemer." The Reasoned Schemer implements a logic programming language in
Scheme that is similar to Prolog.

If you're interested, get the book from Amazon: http://bit.ly/89tulL

This book assumes that you know basics of Scheme. The book can also be viewed
as the 3rd book after "The Little Schemer" and "The Seasoned Schemer".

The code examples were copied (and completed where necessary) from
"The Reasoned Schemer" by Peteris Krumins (peter@catonmat.net).

His blog is at http://www.catonmat.net  --  good coders code, great reuse.

Table of contents:
    ...
    I'll start adding chapters after I read the book (I am currently at
    Chapter 6) and implement the language used in the book myself.

    Otherwise, if I just rewrote the examples, I would not be 100% they
    work as described in the book.

That's it. I hope you find these examples useful when reading "The Reasoned
Schemer" yourself! Go get it at http://bit.ly/89tulL, if you haven't already!
