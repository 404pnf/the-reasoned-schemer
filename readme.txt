This repository contains all the code examples from the book "The Reasoned
Schemer." The Reasoned Schemer implements a logic programming language in
Scheme that is similar to Prolog.

If you're interested, get the book from Amazon: http://bit.ly/89tulL

The code examples were copied (and completed where necessary) from
"The Reasoned Schemer" by Peteris Krumins (peter@catonmat.net).
